# Glider-Climatology
All modules and code from Dan Rudnick to create glider climatology plots

A text file Trinidad_glider_anomaly_instructions.docx contains instructions on how to use the code.
The above document also tells which code was used to prep the glider data for use by the code.  Step by step instructions are listed in that document along with nameing conventions
for saving the files for use with the code later.  The code will create a plot directory with the various plots.  Note that a full set of plots is about 1.2 Gbytes.
Most of the programs needed are in the collection.  NOTE: All data paths have been removed.  The one piece of code to download the ONI was not included as 
removing the data path would make the code meaningless.

The code also requires the <i>Seawater</i> toolbox for matlab (free).  Since this is available elsewhere it isn't included here.
