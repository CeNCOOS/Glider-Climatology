# Glider-Climatology
All modules and code from Dan Rudnick to create glider climatology plots

A text file Trinidad_glider_anomaly_instructions.docx contains instructions on how to use the code.
The code also tells which code was used to prep the glider data for use by the code.  The steps to run the code are in the document above.
Most of the programs needed are in the collection.  NOTE: All data paths have been removed.  The one piece of code to download the ONI was not included as 
removing the data path would make the code meaningless.

The code also requires the <i>Seawater</i> toolbox for matlab (free).  Since this is available elsewhere it isn't included here.
